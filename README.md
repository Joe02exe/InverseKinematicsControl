## Manual


First start the ROS-Shell and roscore
```shell
~/ros_home/ros-shell
```
Start ROS
```shell
roscore
```

Open another terminal and the ROS-Shell and start the launchfile of the package by typing the following:

```shell
roslaunch launch/InverseKinematicsControl.launch
```

This should be it. you should see Rviz. With a delay of about 10 seconds, coppelia will start and the program will be executed. The robot should place the objects in the containers and everything should work just fine.
